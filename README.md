# Recursive Descent

- The script parses mathematical expressions using recursive descent parsing. It iterates through tokens, recognizing operators and operands, and calls corresponding functions. Utilizes a tokenizer to generate tokens from input strings. Parses expressions based on operator precedence and associativity.
